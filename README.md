Features added: Looks prettier on your editor. Easier to modify and use.

1. This script now needs: urllib, requests, datetime and random
2. It is more generic now and can be fairly easily modified to generally comment/like posts on your wall. 
3. Logs data locally into a csv file

Usage:

1. scroll down to the "Configurations" section and fill in access_key with generated access_key that has sufficient permissions.
2. Fiddle around with additional available params
3. Run it :)
